Volume control is a command line utility for setting the speaker volume. It was originally designed to be used in conjuntion with two scheduuled tasks which operate it to mute the volume and re-enable the volume when the computer is locked and unlocked.

USAGE:
1. VolumeControl.exe <volume level, 0-50> (roughly 2 percent per step).
2. VolumeControl.exe 0  - This will mute the volume but keep a record in the registry of the current volume before it is muted.
3. VolumeControl.exe /default  - This will restore the volume back to the previous level.

This can be used on its own as required but is particularly useful when used as described above, esp in a busy environment.

License is free to be used as and when you wish.
